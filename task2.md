# Task 2: Computational Thinking 

## Question Responses 

### 1. Describe the four core computational thinking skills?

1. Decomposition is when you breakdown issues so they're easier to manage 
1. Pattern Recognition is finding finding similarities between problems and using past solutions to apply them to new issues 
1. Abstraction is being able to isolate the issue to get straight to the point 
1. Algorithmic thinking or a set of rules is creating simple steps so anyone can understand 


### 2. What is the most powerful computer? Glad you asked. Watch this video about Sierra Computer. Describe below points that surprised you the most.
The most powerful computer is actually the Summit. Summit is unclassified so it works on “civilian stuff”


However the most surprising points about the Sierra Computer (the second most powerful) are: 
Sierra has become air gapped ( cut off from any other computer network) in order to simulate old warheads 
Warheads are supposed to be replaced repeatedly, without that, and with time, it is unreliable how they will function 
Stockpile Stewardship Program 
Research with Sierra may go against the treaty for nuclear disarmament because it blurs the lines between maintaining old warhead and constructing new ones 
Military simulations are prioritised over other topics such as health and earthquake 

### 3. Supercomputers are currently used to investigate solutions to real life problems from cancer research, Ai, economics, or brain simulation. Military uses are also one major force behind the development of these machines. Analyze the benefits and possible drawbacks of developing supercomputers in our modern world? Should we do it?

The benefits of supercomputers are often described as limitless. They aid in the advancement of technology, health, safety and national security. For example, supercomputers simulate natural disasters, and conduct nuclear and medicine testing. However, building and maintaining supercomputers is extremely costly. For example, Fugaku supercomputer total programme cost 1billion dollars. In regards to an ethical concern,  supercomputers hold significant power and thus can be easily exploited. The militarisation of Sierra shows the duality between ensuring nuclear safety, while also the potential violence that it may lead. 

Supercomputers are important tools and should stay as such. The drawbacks, with the exception of the practical limitations, mostly rely on how supercomputers are used and if there are binding regulations. 

 ### 4. Identify the most advanced computer in Japan (What, specs, location, uses). We might go and visit it :-) 
 
 The most advanced  supercomputer in Japan (and perhaps fastest in the world) is the “Fugaku” (or the “Post-K”). Its total memory bandwidth is 163 PB/s (petabyte) and has a normal computing speed of 2.0 GHz. It also has 48 cores with an additional 4 assistant cores. The Fugaku is used for researching health, climate change and disaster prevention, science, and energy problems. Just this year, the Fugaku was used to find a coronavirus treatment. It is located in the RIKEN centre for Computational Science in Kobe. 
 
 
## Programming Task 
 
### 1. Create a program that shows the colors of all the lockers from 1 to 2400
```.py
c=["red", "white", "yellow", "blue"]*600
for i in range(0,2400):
     print(c[i], i+1)
```

### 2. Using the program above, create another program that allows the user to enter a number and the program outputs the color that should be used in the locker.

### 3. [HL] Create a program that receives a color from the user, validates the input,  and outputs the numbers of the lockers of the color provided.
