# Task 3: Operating Systems

## Question 1: Describe four roles of the Operating systems in a computer

1. Device Drivers
Intermediary between software program and hardware peripherals by programmers talk to I/Os (input-output interfaces) using standardised mechanisms 

1. Multitasking 
Allowing multiple different tasks at the same time/and cpu 

1. Virtual memory
Hiding where the physical memory and making programs think their memory address starts at 0 (making it seem like a continual address) 

1. Memory Protection 
Protects from others programs deleting and modifying data. Example includes time-sharing 

## Question 2: What did you find surprising from the video about the Operating systems (#1) Describe below your point:

I was surprised about how laborious and tedious running a computer was during its early development. Firstly, programmers had to write code by hand on punch cards and manually inserting it in the computer. And even when operating systems were used, code had to be written for each individual device. This meant that programmers had to know a lot more of and hyper-specific information. 

## Question 3: Watch the video showing the market share for the most popular Operating Systems during the last years (#2). Describe the trends shown in the graph.

Throughout all the years, the Windows OSs strongly dominated all other types of operating systems. The MacOS and the Linux both increased with time, however remained significantly less popular than the Windows OS. The only large competition in popularity was between Windows. 

In more specifics, WinXP was the most popular in 2003, while other operating systems became less popular with time.  In 2009, there was a  huge popularity boost with all other operating systems (especially the Win7,). By 2011, Win7 took over the Winxp . By 2013, the win8 took over. MacOS and Linux both increased but still much further behind. Lastly, in 2015, the Win10 attracted a lot of popularity,  quickly surpassing Win7. By 2019, the Win10 was the most used OS, while Win7, MacOS and the Linux had around the same percentage of usage. 

Question 4: Identify the original creators of the Operating Systems in video #2. Add the citations for your sources.

The MacOS was first developed by Steve Jobs in his company, Apple, 1984.

The developers of WinXP, Win7, Win8, and Win10 were all Microsoft. The person who first createtd the first window OS (the bases of the nextt generatiotns) was Bill Gates.

The Linux was developed by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish engineer, in the 90’s.

## Question 5: The list below states some of the least known open source operating systems. Research what they are mainly used for, what graphical interface system they use and what are the minimal specifications of the computer needed to run them. 
1. Red Hat: 

1. CentoOS:

1. SUSE: 

1. Linux Mint: 

1. Fedora: Federa’s main target is for developers and programmers rather than average users. This is because it has a short live cycle (6 month release cycle) and updates often. It is used most often for software development/testing. Fedora does not have a graphical interface as a default, and thus you need to manually install one yourself. Its minimum specifications are: 1GHz Processor, 2GB RAM, and either a CD-DVD drive or a USB stick (bootable media). 

1. Knoppix: Knoppix is a live operating system (pre-installed on a CD/USB/etc.). Because of such, it is a good OS for downloading something without it going directly to your hard drive. It is also used for copying large files which are not accessible to other operating systems and as a “rescue disk.” Rescue disks are CDs, DVDs, or USBs used for checking for malware/viruses without needing to boot your main OS. Its GUI is LXDE. The minimum specifications of Knoppix are: intel/AMD-compatible processor, 32MB (for text mode only) or 2GB (recommended), a bootable optical drive (such as USB, DVD etc.), and a SVGA-compatible graphics card. 

1. Manjaro: Manjaro is used for general-purpose usage, and also is great for 

1. Kali: Kali is known for “advanced penetration testing and security audacity.” This means that it is specialised in simulating cyber attacks and checking a computer systems security.. For its GUI system, Kali uses GNOME. The minimum specifications are: 3.6GB hard disk space, 257MB RAM, and a CD-DVD drive or a USB stick. 

## [HL] Task: Pick one of the OS in the list above (or any other you find which is open source), download it, and install it in your computer using a Virtual Machine (Tutorial Here). Prepare 3 Slides with your experience, plus you will show us the operating system running and some interesting software applications included, check the games and office applications. Enjoy!
